# Rust Tutorial

This is a really basic Rust Tutorial to show what's possible using this tool. In the rust-files directory, you'll find an example file called `rust.rs` which can be compiled and executed on the system.

Compile and execute the file using `rustc rust-files/rust.rs` and then `./rust`

-> COMMANDWAIT rustc rust-files/rust.rs
-> COMMANDWAIT ./rust

Awesome, now we've seen a file get created and run. Let's make a new file that we can work on. Run `touch new-file.rs`

-> FILECHECK rust-files/new-file.rs
